**Looking for maintainers**: This crate is passively maintained. I am looking for new maintainers to take over the project. If you are interested, please open an issue or contact me by email at ekse.0x@gmail.com.

Rust bindings for the [unicorn](http://www.unicorn-engine.org/) CPU emulator.

```rust
use unicorn::{Cpu, CpuX86};

fn main() {
    let x86_code32: Vec<u8> = vec![0x41, 0x4a]; // INC ecx; DEC edx

    let emu = CpuX86::new(unicorn::Mode::MODE_32).expect("failed to instantiate emulator");
    let _ = emu.mem_map(0x1000, 0x4000, unicorn::Protection::ALL);
    let _ = emu.mem_write(0x1000, &x86_code32);
    let _ = emu.reg_write_i32(unicorn::RegisterX86::ECX, -10);
    let _ = emu.reg_write_i32(unicorn::RegisterX86::EDX, -50);

    let _ = emu.emu_start(0x1000, (0x1000 + x86_code32.len()) as u64, 10 * unicorn::SECOND_SCALE, 1000);
    assert_eq!(emu.reg_read_i32(unicorn::RegisterX86::ECX), Ok(-9));
    assert_eq!(emu.reg_read_i32(unicorn::RegisterX86::EDX), Ok(-51));
}
```

## Installation

This project has been tested on Linux, OS X and Windows. The bindings are built for version 1.0 of
unicorn.

This package attempts to build unicorn if it is not already installed on the system. To build
unicorn on Linux and OS X, the following tools are needed : gcc, make, git, python 2.7. Visual
Studio is needed on Windows.

To use unicorn-rs, simply add it as dependency to the Cargo.toml of your program.

```
[dependencies]
unicorn = "0.8.0"
```

## Changelog

### 0.9

Error now implements the Error trait (thanks to @tathanhdinh), the RESOURCE and EXCEPTION
error cases are now supported (thanks to @endeav0r). The CPU context can now be
saved and restored (thanks to @oblivia-simplex). You can find an example use in the
test `x86_context_save_and_restore`, in tests/unicorn.rs. The ffi bindings crate 
unicorn-sys is now no_std by default (thanks to @strake). Finally the crate was migrated
to Rust edition 2018.

Thank you again to all the contributors, your help is always appreciated.

### 0.8.0

Added support for `mem_map_ptr`.

### 0.7.0

Windows is now supported (thanks to kichristensen).

### 0.6.0

We now check if unicorn is installed on the system via pkg-tool and use that version if available.
Otherwise unicorn is compiled when building the package.

### 0.4.0

unicorn is now compiled as part of the build process of unicorn-rs.

### 0.3.0

The handling of callbacks has been modified, callbacks should be implemented using closures. See
the tests for examples.

- added support for interrupt, in/out and sysenter callbacks
