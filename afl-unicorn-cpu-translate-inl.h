   This code is a shim patched into the separately-distributed source
   code of Unicorn 1.0.1. It leverages the built-in QEMU tracing functionality
   to implement AFL-style instrumentation and to take care of the remaining
   parts of the AFL fork server logic.

   The resulting libunicorn binary is essentially a standalone instrumentation
   tool; for an example of how to leverage it for other purposes, you can
   have a look at afl-showmap.c.
